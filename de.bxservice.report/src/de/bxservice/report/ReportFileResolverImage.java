/**
 * This FileResolver allows to load Images directly from the AD_Image table. You
 * have to use a filename like "AD_Image:1000123.jpg" to load the images with
 * the database ID 1000123. You have to be sure that the filetype suffix is
 * identical, the file is not converted. (or use no suffix, JasperReports can
 * read an image without knowing the filename suffix). This works with images
 * saved as binary into the database or images saved as an URL String.
 * 
 * You can also read the image direct into your jasper report with a sql query.
 * If you want to do this you have to use "InputStream" as the Expression Class
 * and use an expression like this:
 * "new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream((byte[])$F{binarydata})".
 * 
 * The main difference is that from the view of JasperReports this FileResolver
 * allows to give an fixed filename and JasperReports can be configured to cache
 * the image. If you use a logo image in your page header then the logo will be
 * loader only once into your pdf. If you use an expression type of InputStream
 * then JasperReports can never be sure that the Image is the same and will save
 * every single image instance into the output file.
